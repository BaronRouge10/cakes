        My name is Delilah Jaeger and I have been baking for as long as I can
        remember. It started off as making chocolate chip cookies every weekend
        for our family dinners ever since I was little. It was not until Covid
        began in 2020, that baking turned into a hobby of mine. I was in 8th grade
        at the time and due to all the free time that we had, I started to bake
        for fun. I would experiment in all sorts of deserts, trying out different
        recipes every week. I would make treats that my mom and I would then
        deliver to loved ones to put smiles on their faces and spread joy during
        those hard times. Thatâ€™s where I found my joy in baking because it allows
        you to make others happy. Ever since then, I have become the baker of the
        family and I now make all the birthday deserts and holiday treats. My
        cousin, Desmond Bougon, who happens to be the same age as me, has been
        with me through this process and has helped me create this project. He
        created the entire website and helped design the business. Both of us are
        currently 17 years old, going into our senior years of High School and we
        live in San Francisco, California. Our goal with creating this website is
        to spread the word about my baking and to allow the happiness of sweets to
        be shared with others!
