          My name is Delilah Jaeger and I have been baking for as long as I can
          remember. It started off as making chocolate chip cookies every weekend
          for our family dinners ever since I was little. It was not until Covid
          began in 2020, that baking turned into a hobby of mine. I was in 8th grade
          at the time and due to all the free time that we had, I started to bake
          for fun. I would experiment in all sorts of deserts, trying out different
          recipes every week. I would make treats that my mom and I would then
          deliver to loved ones to put smiles on their faces and spread joy during
          those hard times. Thatâ€™s where I found my joy in baking because it allows
          you to make others happy. Ever since then, I have become the baker of the
          family and I now make all the birthday deserts and holiday treats. My
          cousin, Desmond Bougon, who happens to be the same age as me, has been
          with me through this process and has helped me create this project. He
          created the entire website and helped design the business. Both of us are
          currently 17 years old, going into our senior years of High School and we
          live in San Francisco, California. Our goal with creating this website is
          to spread the word about my baking and to allow the happiness of sweets to
          be shared with others!
